# Problem Statement

Drug optimization requires balancing multiple competing objectives: high on-target binding affinity, minimal off-target binding, favorable drug-likeness (QED), synthetic accessibility (SA), and scaffold similarity. Current approaches suffer from three limitations: (1) manual off-target panel curation, (2) lack of systematic off-target identification, and (3) fragmented multi-objective optimization.

Off-target identification is non-trivial. Considering all human proteins is computationally intractable. Instead, off-targets should be selected based on biological relevance---proteins interacting with the primary target in PPI networks or known safety targets. This requires integration of biological knowledge bases with molecular generation pipelines.
